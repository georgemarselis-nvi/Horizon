Horizon adds automated policy-driven tiering with hooks to Tundra 



<!-- 
a killer feature:

Real-time per-project usage
Metadata heatmaps
Quota + tier insight without crawling
Works at zettabyte scale
No one has built this cleanly. Build it into Stratum or a side module.
Every HPC admin will want it.

BeeGFS (and most HPC FS) don’t track usage live, they rely on:
Daily cronjobs
Full FS crawls
Manual parsing of du/find
It’s brittle, slow, and error-prone.
You build real-time project-level tracking?
That’s another enterprise-grade product right there.

Plasma:

interactive treemap support/module  visual/reporting module of Horizon via a separate Horizon-querying daemon, like treewiz/baobab does. as fast as that. 
and simple reports to users that show them usage. they can go log in if htey want full analysis.


is a great name:
Evokes energy, flow, and visibility
Fits thematically with Horizon, Aurora, Tundra
Sounds fast, dynamic—perfect for real-time storage heatmaps
